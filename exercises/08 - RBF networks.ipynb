    "In this exercise, we will be doing image classification with a simple neural network. For simplicity, let's assume we will be working with black and white images.\n",
    "Given an input image $i$ represented as a vector of  pixel intensities $ \\mathbf{x}_i \\in [0,1]^d$, we want to predict its correct label $\\mathbf{y}_i$, which is represented as a one-hot vector in $\\{0,1\\}^K$, where $K$ is the number of possible categories (classes) that the image may belong to. For example, we may have pictures of cats and dogs, and our goal would be to correctly tag those images as either cat or dog. In that case we would have $K=2$, and the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$ to represent the classes of cat and dog.  \n",

    "In the context of classification, neural networks are models that given one (or multiple) input data points produce as output a set of corresponding labels for each input. The model itself consists of parametric functions $g_i$ which can be applied sequentially to the input data, resulting in a set of labels which are the model's prediction for the data. For example, in a model that consists of two parameteric functions $g_1$ and $g_2$, for a given $\\mathbf{x}_i$, we have the predicted label $ \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_i = g_1(g_2(\\mathbf{x}_i))$. The parametric functions are commonly called \"layers\".\n",

    "In a standard image classification setup, we are given some training data which we can use to tune the parameters of the parametric functions $g_i$ in order to improve its ability to predict the labels correctly. The parameters are generally tuned with respect to some objective (commonly called a loss function). We want to find the parameters of the model that minimize this loss function. Various loss functions can be used, but in general they tend to encode how \"wrong\" the model is. For\n",
